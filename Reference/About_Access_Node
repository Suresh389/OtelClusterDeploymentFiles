Deploy the pod:

sh
kubectl apply -f access-node.yaml
Get a shell into the pod:

sh
kubectl exec -it access-node -- /bin/bash
List All Directories in /var
From the pod shell, list all directories in /var to see if there's another location where logs might be stored:

sh
ls /var
If you find directories like lib or log, explore them further:

sh
ls /var/lib
ls /var/log
Use find to Locate Log Files
You can use the find command to search for log files:

sh
find /var -name '*.log'
