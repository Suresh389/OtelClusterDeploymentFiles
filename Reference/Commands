Memory: container_memory_usage_bytes: This metric indicates the current memory usage of a container in bytes. Additional metrics might track cache and swap usage.

Disk: container_fs_reads_total and container_fs_writes_total: These metrics track the total number of disk reads and writes performed by a container.

Network: container_network_receive_bytes_total and container_network_transmit_bytes_total: These metrics track the total bytes received and transmitted by a container over the network.
